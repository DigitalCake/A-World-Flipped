 FRANCE_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "The memory of the Great War lingers in the minds of the French people.

 OTHER_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "The Western democracies are failing. Trotsky exploits the fears and the economic turmoil into gathering support for communists worldwide to participate in a grand World Revolution. Far right leagues and fascist figure heads mobilize against the growing communist threat. Democracy as an idea may be stomped out in fear of some greater.
