 FRANCE_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "Although France was part of the victorious Entente during the Great War, time has not boded well for the French Republic. With the rise of Communism in Soviet Russia and the rise of Fascism in Italy, France is increasingly being swept up in the two battling ideological currents. As Blueshirts and CGT militias battle in the streets of Paris, there are whispers of discontent being uttered from the Military and the National Bloc. Will the Third Republic prevail alive?"
 USA_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "The Bald Eagle's defiant democracy has fallen into disarray. In the Post-Great War  United States 2 conservative presidents have attempted to undermine the efforts of more radical parties that have risen massively in popularity. With his victory in the 1932 election radicals are hopeful that Franklin Delano Roosevelt could be just the person needed to mend the divide in the nation. In 1933 the nation is on the brink of disaster as Trotskyists, Anarchists, Militarists, Fascists and more all vie for power."
 ENGLAND_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "Despite being a victor in the Great War, Britain is in a state of instability. The conservative central government has proved itself unable to deal with the communist threat or enforce the treaty of Versailles. Now communism is on the rise in Britain, with fascist parties led by Oswald Mosley, vowing to save Britain from the reds. The future is uncertain, and the British people must choose between two extremes."
 GERMANY_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "Once more will Germany’s Democracy will be tested. Communism though divided still processes a great threat to the democratic order that flourished during the 1920s on the surface. The death of Hitler in the failed Beerhall Putsch lead to the NSDAP falling apart and to be fought between different high ranking figures. Muller’s Grand Coalition managed to barely control the economic situation with secret rearmament arrangements. The Soviet Union’s meddling has worsened the situation, Germany seeks to strike the source of communist outbreaks, but first the Treaty of Versailles must go."
 ITALY_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "The Italian Wolf struggles through the forest of diplomacy . Betrayed by Britain and France after the Great War, Italy turned to elsewhere for comfort. After attempting to gain control through democracy, Benito Mussolini and his allies seized control of the country with the March on Rome in 1922. Throughout the 1920s Italy restructured, and watched as the world changed in unexpected ways. With conflict on the horizon, the wolf must choose, will they seek assistance from neighboring nations, or brave the storm alone?"
 JAPAN_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "After suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Manchurians in 1932, the Japanese army is disgraced and the rise of a civilian government has overtaken the military. With democratic sympathies rising, and the threat of communism from both China and the Soviet Union, Japan must choose whether they will change their traditions, or submit to their new Communist overlords."
 RUSSIA_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "Trotsky had secured the leadership after the death of Lenin. Under his leadership he completed the first 5 Year Plan and brought much prosperity to the land, but mass starvation in Ukraine is a major issue. Leader of the Communist International and promising to ready the Soviet Union for the World Revolution, he must first deal with Ukrainian unrest and a very hostile world if he is to achieve the World Revolution."
 OTHER_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "The Western democracies are failing. Trotsky exploits the fears and the economic turmoil into gathering support for communists worldwide to participate in a grand World Revolution. Far right leagues and fascist figure heads mobilize against the growing communist threat. Democracy as an idea may be stomped out in fear of some greater. The world is heading towards another great conflict..."

 CANADA_FALL_DEMOCRACY_DESC_LOC:0 "Due to a series of early reforms after a liberal victory in 1930, Canada has avoided many of the effects of the Great Depression, and after their success at the 1932 Imperial Conference, they have become a model nation for the rest of the Commonwealth. But the situation has not at all been peaceful, with the rise of Fascism in the British Isles, and the threat of a communist revolution, even within their own borders, has forced Canada to be ready to protect themselves from an uncertain future..."
